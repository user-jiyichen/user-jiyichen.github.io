Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto, advised by Professor [Radu Craiu](https://raducraiu.com/) and Professor [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/). I am also an Affiliate Researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 

My research focuses on Bayesian methodology, probabilistic modeling, and approximate inference. My current project works on Bayesian hierarchical modeling for probabilistic population projections. I also co-organize the department’s Bayesian reading group.

I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2024, where I spent two wonderful years and was very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/) and Professor [Per Mykland](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~mykland/). Before UChicago, I received my B.S. in Statistics and Financial Mathematics, also from UofT. My master's thesis was on large-scale realized volatility prediction with machine learning (see my [presentation slides](/files/Master_Thesis_Presentation_Slides.pdf)). Influenced by my prior academic training and research, I have continued to develop a side interest in financial econometrics.

Outside of research, I spend a decent amount of time behind the lens and on the court. I enjoy the [theory](https://www.lab404.com/3741/readings/sontag.pdf) and practice of photography, and I carry the spirit of sportsmanship in the game of basketball and life.
