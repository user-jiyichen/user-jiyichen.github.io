Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto, advised by Professor [Radu Craiu](https://raducraiu.com/) and Professor [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/). I am also an Affiliate Researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 

I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2024, where I was very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/) and Professor [Per Mykland](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~mykland/). Before UChicago, I received my B.S. in Statistics and Financial Mathematics, also from UofT. 

My research focuses on Bayesian methodology, probabilistic modeling, and approximate inference. My current project works on Bayesian modeling for generating probabilistic population projections. My master's thesis was on large-scale realized volatility prediction with machine learning (see my [presentation slides](/files/Master_Thesis_Presentation_Slides.pdf) and [paper](/files/YichenJi_Master_Thesis_Unsigned.pdf)). Influenced by my prior academic training and research, I have continued to develop a side interest in financial econometrics.

Outside of research, I spend a decent amount of time behind the lens or on the court. I enjoy the theory and practice of photography, and I carry the spirit of sportsmanship in the game of basketball and life.
