Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Toronto, advised by Professor [Radu Craiu](https://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/craiu/) and Professor [Monica Alexander](https://www.monicaalexander.com/). I received my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2024, where I was very fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/) and Professor [Per Mykland](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~mykland/). Prior to UChicago, I received my B.S. in Statistics and Financial Mathematics also from UofT.

My research focuses on Bayesian methodology, probabilistic modeling, and approximate inference. My current project develops Bayesian models and computational techniques for generating probabilistic population projections.

My master's thesis was on large-scale realized volatility prediction with machine learning (see my [presentation slides](/files/Master_Thesis_Presentation_Slides.pdf) and [paper](/files/YichenJi_Master_Thesis_Unsigned.pdf)). Influenced by my prior academic training and research, I continue to have a side interest in financial econometrics and mathematical finance.
