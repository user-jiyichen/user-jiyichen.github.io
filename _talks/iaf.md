This presentation discusses the interplay between Variational Inference and Normalizing Flows, and explains a specific type of NF called inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) proposed in the paper [Improved variational inference with inverse autoregressive flow" by Kingma et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04934).
